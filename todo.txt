TODO:
- PCA offline
- PCA online
- verbosity? (do we really need it)
- GEM does not recognize a change in the distriution!!

FUTURE DEVELOPEMENT
- detect mean change 
- detect variance change 
- detect change in both
- hyperparameter optimization

NOTES
- tried to optimize pca with matrixes, the math works but it's slower :(  (you pessimised?)
