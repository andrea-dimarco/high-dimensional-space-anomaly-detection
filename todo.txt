TODO:
- PCA flags regular datasets as anomalies -> hyperparameters?
- GEM flags regular datasets as anomalies -> hyperparameters!
- verbosity for GEM
- GEM does not recognize a change in the distributions
- PCA does not recognize a change in the distributions

FUTURE DEVELOPEMENT
- detect mean change 
- detect variance change 
- detect change in both
- hyperparameter optimization
- a lot of online detections are found at delay 5417 (??)
