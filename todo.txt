TODO:
- define test cases for all safe samples
- define test cases for all anomalous samples
- choose nevergrad optimization algorithm (maybe Powell)
- define objective function metric for black-box optimization
- hyperparameter optimization

FUTURE DEVELOPEMENT:
- GEM does not recognize a change in the distributions
- PCA does not recognize a change in the distributions
- detect mean change 
- detect variance change 
- detect change in both
