# Anomaly Detection in High-Dimensional Spaces (2023)

This repository contains our project for the course in Automatic Verification of Intelligent Systems and the AFC of Sapienza University.

The objective is the implementation of a system capable of online detection of anomalies in high dimensional data. 

Depending on the intrinsic dimensionality of the data, the algorithm chooses either a GEM based or a PCA based strategy to extract summary statistics and decide if an anomaly was detected.

The work is greatly inspired by the paper [Real-Time Nonparametric Anomaly Detection in High-Dimensional Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05250)
