# Anomaly Detection in High-Dimensional Spaces (2023)
aka stealth attacks.

This repository contains our project for the course in Automatic Verification of Intelligent Systems of Sapienza University and the AFC.

The objective is the implementation of a system capable of online detection of anomalies in high dimensional data. 

The work is greatly inspired by the paper [Real-Time Nonparametric Anomaly Detection in High-Dimensional Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05250)
